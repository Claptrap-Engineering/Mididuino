# Mididuino
A midicontroller based on an arduino nano

The original code can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwnVMB_6yujwR1dydVJ6MHJib2M/view
This code is written by Dave from notes and volts @ https://www.notesandvolts.com

To make the code work you must install the midi library files.
You can find these at https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library/releases/tag/4.2

The adapted code to set the multiplexers to accept the 16 potmeters is available at this site in the MIDI_controller folder.
